%% If you need to create a section, here is a sample code snippet
%% \section[Short Title]{Title of Section}

%% Here for subsection
%% \subsection[Short Title]{Title of Section}

%% If you don't want the numbers before section, use this
%% \section*[Short Title]{Title of Section}

%% If you want to add an itemized list (bulleted list)
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Sample item
%% \end{itemize}

%% If you want to add an enumerate list (numbered list)
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Sample item
%% \end{enumerate}

%% If you want to add a description list
%% \begin{description}

%% \end{description}
